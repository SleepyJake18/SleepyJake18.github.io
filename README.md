My Personal Portfolio on Git Hub. This page will be used to display my growth as a developer over the course of my continuing education in the field. Not only will the page itself display my personal style, it will also give you a little insight into who I am as a person and have to link to projects I have completed and collaborated on. At the bottom you will find my contact information. If you like what you see, please feel free to reach out with any opportunities matching my current skill set. I look forward to working with you, and developing my skill set along the way.
